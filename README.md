# Machine Learning for Prediction of Chronic Wound Healing Trajectories

This repository contains the code for developing and validating machine learning models to predict the healing of chronic wounds.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- pandas == 2.0.3
- numpy == 1.25.2
- scikit-learn == 1.2.2
- matplotlib == 3.7.1
- seaborn == 0.13.1

## Usage

The repository contains two Jupyer notebook files. The `model_development` notebook contains the code used to train the models and their tune hyperparameters. The `model_validation` notebook evaluates the performance of the models on a held-out testing/validation set.
